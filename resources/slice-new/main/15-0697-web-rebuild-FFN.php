            <strong>Friday Fun Nights</strong> are special events held at Oklahoma Children’s Theatre each month. We
            play games, make
            crafts, have a fun dinner, dance a little and most importantly stretch our imaginations! Friday Fun Night
            gives parents a few hours to themselves, and gives kids a fun night of hanging out at the theatre.
          </p>

          <p>
            Spaces are limited, call 606-7003 to make your reservations. $25 for each child. Ages 5-12 are recommended.
