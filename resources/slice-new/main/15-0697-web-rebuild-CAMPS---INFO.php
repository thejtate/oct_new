          <h4>Before & After Care</h4>

          <p>
            Camp hours are 9am-4pm. Before/Aftercare is available from 8-9am and 4-6pm for an additional $8 per day or
            $35
            per week. 5-day camps will not have After Care on Fridays due to end-of-camp performances. Before and/or
            After
            Care can both be used for the same price per day. Before/Aftercare payments are not discounted or prorated
            and
            are non- refundable. You can prepay at the time of enrollment, or pay per daily use. If paying per day,
            charges
            are due upon drop off for Before Care and upon pickup for After Care. Campers arriving before 8:45am and
            staying
            past 4:15pm will be charged for Before/After Care.

          <h4>Daily Camp Activities</h4>

          <p>
            Each day campers will experience the magic of theatre, brush up their performance skills, and learn
            performing
            arts basics in a fun environment of creativity and imagination. Seasonal camps always include lots of
            theatre-based games and activities--we focus on fun while developing campers' dramatic skills such as stage
            directions, vocal projection, and improvisation. Camp hours are 9:00am to 4:00pm; Before & Aftercare is
            available 8am-9am & 4pm-6pm. Campers will need a sack lunch, two snacks, and a drink each day. The Camp
            Store
            will be available for campers to purchase snacks and drinks during snack times.
          </p>

          <h4>Camp Performances</h4>

          <p>
            All week-long camps will include a Friday performance or other showcase. Performances are free of charge and
            all
            friends and family are invited to watch. Since the performances are devised by the campers and teachers,
            camcorders and cameras are encouraged!
          </p>
