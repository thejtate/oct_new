Our Pre-School classes run Monday-Friday, from 9:00 am until 12:00 pm. We're excited to offer 4 consecutive sessions of our half day Pre-School camps this summer beginning June 5th.</p>

All of our week-long camps are separated by age not experience, and our expert instructors tailor each class to the talents of their students. These summer day camps run Monday to Friday from 9:00 am until 4:00 pm each day, with optional Extended Care available from 8:00 am - 6:00 pm. All of our camps conclude with a final viewing, with performing arts classes presenting their work in our Friday recital, and our arts and design classes presenting a viewing of their work.

Carefully tailored for our older students, these intensive art classes run parallel to our week-long camps, running at same time, from 9:00 am - 4:00 pm Monday to Friday. All of our ArtLAB classes are designed to teach older children and teens to embrace creative thinking as they encounter a range of artistic disciplines and interactive workshops. All ArtLAB take place in the professionally equipped Norick Art Center, located one block north of our main building on the campus of Oklahoma City University and conclude with a public art gallery style viewing at the end of each week.</p>

                                <p>Our summer wouldn't be complete without the excitement of productions hitting the big stage. This summer we are bringing four great shows to life, including two Main Stage Shows, and two Stage Two productions.</p>
                                <p>Mainstage Shows are part of our regular season and include a demanding rehearsal period and a longer public run. These shows are perfect for young actors aged 11-16, who are looking for a more intensive experience. These shows have in-depth rehearsal periods, and auditions are required. This year we are excited to present Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Seussical the Musical.</p>
                                <p>Our Stage-Two shows are the perfect answer for young actors who are new to productions, as well as students who aren't quite old enough for our Main-Stage shows. Each of these shows run over a two-week rehearsal period and conclude with three final performances. Our Stage-Two shows for this summer are Twice Upon a Time and Sherlock Holmes and the Case of the Missing Man.</p>
