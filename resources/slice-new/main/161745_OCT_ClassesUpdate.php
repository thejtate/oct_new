              <p>
                Join us for the return of Young Company as we bring to the stage a modern adaptation of Charles Dicken's
                classic A Christmas Carol. Our young performers will work with alongside their dedicated directors and
                technical staff to create a special 30-40 minute traditional stage production.
              </p>

              <p>
                Rehearsals will be held each Saturday 9:00am-12:00pm from November 5 – December 17 (excluding Thanksgiving
                week), and all week 9:00am-4:00pm December 19-23 as part of our Winter Break Camp, with final performances
                December 22 & 23 at 7pm.
